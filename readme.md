# Zen Tags &mdash; for Zen Cart 1.5.6 and later

_ZenTags_ provides enhancements to the base Zen Cart functionality:
1. The creation of `tag` values, similar to the like-named WordPress items, that can be associated with a store's categories and/or products.  This provides you with another method to group your products.
2. Modification to the Zen Cart _built-in_ advanced search processing to allow searches to be performed against these tags.
3. A new sidebox, `zen_tag_cloud`, that displays a WordPress-like display of the tags currently defined.
